Lab Assignment #4
-----------------------
1. In the tutorial, we are asked to use the python script to run from any directory. For our purposes, we do not need this, so we navigated into the directory containing the tutorial code and our batch job script from there. See attached code. We allocated 32 tasks in the batch job and ran the script to execute on 32 hosts. Successful output was printed in the slurm-194675 output file.
